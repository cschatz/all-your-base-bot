# AllYourBASE Bot

This repo contains the source code for the AllYourBase bot.

It doesn't currently use any package management in a sensible way, sorry!
The only unusual dependency it has is the Python API for Discord. One
typical way to install that:

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

Launch the bot from within the root of the project directory with:

```
python3 ayb-bot
```
